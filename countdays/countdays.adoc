This was a program I wrote a while ago (2003) to demonstrate what can be done
with template metaprogramming in `C++`. It's based on Todd Veldhuilzen's article
<<1>> on template metaprograms. Basically a template metaprogram is something
that the compiler runs to generate more code. It's a way of getting the compiler
to do the work for you. Additionally the template language is 'Turing complete'
which basically means that if a problem is computable then the language can be
used to write an algorithm for it.
