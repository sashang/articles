Mergesort in Julia
==================
Sashan Govender

I became interested in learning more about Julia because it was

* based on LLVM (none of this JVM/Java bullshit)
* supports first class functions
* support for parallelization of tasks over multiple cores or nodes is built into the language

so in the tradition of not many other first programs in a new language I wrote a
link:https://github.com/sashang/notebook_of_code/tree/master/julia/merge-sort[merge sort routine]

It doesn't use any of the features of the language I'm interested in, however:

* I did it in about an hour and a half.
* I learnt to use 1 as the base index offset after years of using 0.
* Someone more versed in Julia could probably rewrite the combine part of the merge sort using fancy
  zips and maps
* I learnt not to expect `1/2` to return `1`.
