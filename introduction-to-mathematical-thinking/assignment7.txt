== 4

_Explain why proving φ ⇒ ψ and ψ ⇒ φ establishes the truth of φ ⇔ ψ._

Because stem:[(psi => phi) ^ (phi => psi)] is the definition of stem:[(psi <=> phi)].

== 6

_6. Prove that if five investors split a payout of $2M, at least one investor receives at least
$400,000._

Assume not one investor received $400000 or more. In other words all investors received less than
$400000.

stem:[(AA x in I)[recv(x) < 400000]]

Then the sum of all received money must be less than 2M. But this can't be true since the initial
sum was $2M and we can't split that and then sum it and have less than $2M. Therefore the initial
assumption must be false.

== 10

_Prove or disprove the statement "An integer n is divisible by 12 if and only if stem:[n^3] is divisible by
12."_

If we want to prove it we need to show:

stem:[(12|n => 12|n^3) ^^ (12|n^3 => 12|n)]

To disprove we need to show one of the above conditionals is false.

Let n = 6, then the condition stem:[12|n^3 => 12|n] is false because 12 divides 216 but 12 does not
divide into 6.
