== 1

Find two unambiguous (but natural sounding) sentences equivalent to the sentence:
 +
_The man saw the woman with a telescope_,
 +
the ﬁrst where the man has the telescope, the second where the woman has the telescope.

=== Answer

The man used the telescope to see the woman.
 +
The man without the telescope saw the woman with the telescope.

== 2

For each of the three ambiguous newspaper headlines I stated in the lecture, rewrite it in a way
that avoids the amusing second meaning, while retaining the brevity of a typical headline:

. Sisters reunited after ten years in checkout line at Safeway.
. Large hole appears in High Street. City authorities are looking into it.
. Mayor says bus passengers should be belted.

=== Answer

. Sisters separated for 10 years reunited in checkout line at Safeway.
. Large hole appears in High Street. City authorities are looking into the cause.
. Mayor says bus passengers should use seat belts.

== 3

The following notice was posted on the wall of a hospital emergency room:
 +
_No head injury is too trivial to ignore._
 +
Reformulate to avoid the unintended second reading. (The context for this sentence is so strong that
many people have diﬃculty seeing there is an alternative meaning.)

=== Answer

Head injury is too trivial to ignore.

== 4
You often see the following notice posted in elevators:
 +
_In case of fire, do not use elevator._
 +
This one always amuses me. Comment on the two meanings and reformulate to avoid the unintended
second reading. (Again, given the context for this notice, the ambiguity is not problematic.)

=== Answer

If there is a fire do not use elevator

== 5
Official documents often contain one or more pages that are empty apart from one sentence at the bottom:
 +
_This page intentionally left blank._
 +
Does the sentence make a true statement? What is the purpose of making such a statement? What
reformulation of the sentence would avoid any logical problems about truth? (Once again, the context
means that in practice everyone understands the intended meaning and there is no problem. But the
formulation of a similar sentence in mathematics at the start of the twentieth century destroyed one
prominent mathematician’s seminal work and led to a major revolution in an entire branch of
mathematics.)

=== Answer

A page with text _This page intentionally left blank_ is not a blank page.

== 6
Find (and provide citations for) three examples of published sentences whose literal meaning is
(clearly) not what the writer intended. [This is much easier than you might think. Ambiguity is very
common.]

=== Answer

I helped my uncle jack off a horse.

== 7

Comment on the sentence “The temperature is hot today.” You hear people say things like this all the
time, and everyone understands what is meant. But using language in this sloppy way in mathematics
would be disastrous.

=== Answer

Temperature can't be hot. Temperature is a metric, a unit of measurement.

== 8

How would you show that not every number of the form N = (p1 ·p2 ·p3 · ...
·pn) + 1 is prime, where p1,p2,p3,...,pn,... is the list of all prime numbers?

=== Answer

Find a counter example.

== JUST FOR FUN

=== 1
Provide a context and a sentence within that context, where the word and occurs ﬁve times in
succession, with no other word between those ﬁve occurrences. (You are allowed to use punctuation.)

=== Answer

_A shipping ship shipping ships_ (not quite what the question wants but funny nevertheless)


=== 2

Provide a context and a sentence within that context, where the words and, or, and, or, and
occur in that order, with no other word between them. (Again, you can use punctuation.)
