== 1

Build a truth table to prove the claim I made earlier that φ ⇔ ψ is true if φ and ψ are both true
or both false, and φ ⇔ ψ is false if exactly one of φ, ψ is true and the other false. (To constitute
a proof, your table should have columns that show how the entries for φ ⇔ ψ are derived, one
operator at a time.)

|===
| stem:[psi] | stem:[phi] | stem:[psi => phi] | stem:[phi => psi] | stem:[phi => psi ^^ psi => phi]
| T | T | T | T | T
| T | F | F | T | F
| F | T | T | F | F
| F | F | T | T | T

== 2

Build a truth table to show that +
(φ ⇒ ψ) ⇔ (¬φ ∨ ψ) +
is true for all truth values of φ and ψ. A statement whose truth values are all T is called a logical
validity, or sometimes a tautology

|===
| stem:[phi] | stem:[psi] | stem:[ neg phi] | stem:[phi => psi] | stem:[ neg phi vv psi ] |
stem:[(psi => phi) => (neg phi vv psi)] | stem:[(psi => phi) <= (neg phi vv psi)] |
stem:[(psi => phi) <=> (neg phi vv psi)]
| T | T | F | T | T | T | T | T

Build a truth table to show that +
latexmath:[(\phi \nRightarrow \psi) \Leftrightarrow (\phi \wedge \neg \psi)] +
is a tautology. +

The ancient Greeks formulated a basic rule of reasoning for proving mathematical statements.
Called modus ponens, it says that if you know φ and you know φ ⇒ ψ, then you can conclude ψ. +
(a) Construct a truth table for the logical statement +
stem:[phi ^^ (phi => psi) => psi] +


|===
| stem:[phi] | stem:[psi] | stem:[ phi => psi ] | stem:[phi ^^ (phi => psi)] |
stem:[phi ^^ (phi => psi) => psi]
| T | T | T | T | T
| T | F | F | F | T
| F | T | T | F | T
| F | F | T | F | T
|===

(b) Explain how the truth table you obtain demonstrates that modus ponens is a valid rule of
inference.

The cases were we know both stem:[phi] and stem:[phi => psi] are true are given on the 1st line. On
the other lines one of them is false (i.e. we don't know one of them). In those cases stem:[psi] is
either true or false and we can't say which one it is. But on the first line, where both
stem:[phi] and stem:[phi => psi], are true there is no ambiguity.

== 5

Provide an analogous logical argument to show that ¬(φ ∨ ψ) and (¬φ) ∧ (¬ψ) are equivalent.

. stem:[phi vv psi] means at least one of stem:[phi] or stem:[psi] is true
. Then stem:[neg(phi vv psi)] means it's not the case that at least one of stem:[phi] or stem:[psi]
is true.
. So the only case where stem:[neg(phi vv psi)] is true will be when stem:[psi] and stem:[phi] are both false.
. Which means that stem:[neg psi ^^ neg phi] is true.

== 6

By a denial of a statement φ we mean any statement equivalent to ¬φ. Give a useful (and hence
natural sounding) denial of each of the following statements.
(a) 34,159 is a prime number.
34,159 is not a prime number

(b) Roses are red and violets are blue.
Rose are not red or violets are not blue.

(c) If there are no hamburgers, I’ll have a hot dog.
If there are no hamburgers, I won't have a hot dog.

(d) Fred will go but he will not play.
Fred will go and he will play.

(e) The number x is either negative or greater than 10.
The number x is neither negative nor greater than 10.

(f) We will win the first game or the second.
We will not win the first game nor the second. (Same as 'we will not win the first game and not the
second' in colloqial English)
