""Mannered as a novel, filthy only where story requires it, all meat pies and
monarchy—this is a place Blue loves, and hates herself for loving.""
-- Amal El-Mohtar & Max Gladstone, This is How You Lose the Time War

Beautiful hard sci-fi, a gemstone cut and placed. Confusing and chaotic but
persist, and read because the confusion you experience is a metaphor for the
initial throes of romantic love.

This novel is an everything. The prose is restrained but still tastefully
decorated without traipsing into the ostentatious (The Book Thief - I'm looking
at you).

As I read this passage:

London Next—the same day, month, year, but one strand over—is the kind of
London other Londons dream: sepia tinted, skies strung with dirigibles, the
viciousness of empire acknowledged only as a rosy backdrop glow redolent of
spice and petalled sugar.

I could not but help recall this from The Book Thief:

Personally, I like a chocolate-coloured sky. Dark, dark chocolate.

One is believable, the other isn't.footnote:[For my scathing review of The Book Thief see

I could go on and I will.

Brilliantly able to evoke London in a sentence, the following is just one of
many gems in this novel.

This novel creeps up on you. Without the novel spelling it out, you feel the
spiral between Red and Blue{empty}footnote:[The book has two authors. If you
want to know who wrote which parts notice the colours in the cover art.]
growing tighter. You feel their rivalry and admiration of each other as they
wage a spy versus spy game of four-dimensional chess. Born on two opposing
sides of a war, their admiration transforms into curiosity and then into love.
And fear, the fear about what their factions will do if they find out.

I cried at the end.
