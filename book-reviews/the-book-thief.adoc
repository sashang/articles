Finally. I finished the Book Thief. Death, he writes.

A bit like this.

But I’ll spare you his idiosyncratic writing style and the little pieces of the surreal forcefully injected into reality.
For example, sentences like

[quote]
It didn’t stop her from pulling a lump of salt water from her eye and feeding it onto Max Venderburg’s face.

and

[quote]
Personally, I like a chocolate-coloured sky. Dark, dark chocolate.

that I never quite knew how to imagine. Oh, I know it’s figurative but the part of me that interprets things literally kicks into gear when the when the figurative turns into a clown’s juggling act with words in a sentence, and leaves me floundering in an indeterminate state between belief and disbelief. Do I let the chocolate coloured sky rest in my head like and advertisement for Cadbury? Do I let Liesel pinch between her thumb and forefinger a glistening tear and feed it into Max’s open mouth?

Apparently we are in Germany during WW2. They speak German in Germany, which is why the author adds German words into English sentences within an English language book, just to remind us that they speak German in Germany and that this is a book about Germany and to add that sense of realism to a book where the narrator is a personification of an intangible concept called death. He may as well have written words in Klingon for all I care.

And as I was reading this book I kept thinking about Reaper Man by Terry Pratchett, and his characterisation of Death and how much better it was, and how he used it as a mirror to illustrate the human condition in that special humorous Pratchett-like way that only he (and Douglas Adams) are capable of. Compared with them, Zusak’s insights are sparse and banal. He loves to write about how he ‘plucks souls’ and ‘cradles’ them but anything more perceptive is lacking.

The book took me longer to read than it should. It drags for ages in the middle, while we wait for essentially not much to happen, and Zusak can build on the endearing characteristics of his main characters and set them up to be obliterated at the end so that the readers can have a good cry and Kleenex executives can snort more cocaine.
