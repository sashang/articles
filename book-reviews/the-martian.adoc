This is what happens when MacGyver meets Mars. Alone. For a year and half. I
expected it to be an introspective heavy read and the book a monologue between
Mark (the stranded astronaut) and Mars. However, the book is not like that and
there are numerous scenes with characters from Mission Control as they plan to
return Mark to Earth and scenes including the astronauts on the ship leaving
Mars. And this is where the book loses it a bit because it becomes too
Hollywood; the very first chapter where Mission Control is introduced read like
a script from a Hollywood movie. Mark is also way too upbeat for someone
stranded on Mars for a year. I got the feeling that he would 'yippeekayyay' all
over the planet if he could and the psychological effects of such extreme
isolation were just an after thought by the author not worth exploring. There's
very little that addresses his state of mind. I guess that's why they've made a
movie of it. You could hand this book to a lazy bunch of script writers and
they could copy and paste it verbatim into a movie script. Regardless I still
got caught up in Mark's struggle to survive, tolerated the numerous chemistry
lessons (ok I got tired of them after a while) and was happy when he made it
home in a rocket fuelled canvas tent. This book should be mandatory reading for
anyone attempting a Mars landing.
