Testing Blogpost
===================
Sashan Govender

Editing articles in the wordpress html editor is awkward if you already have a
better tool. In my case I know vim fairly well and enjoy using it as a text
editor. And I also like using asciidoc for generating articles. Fortunately the
smart man who made
link:http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/userguide.html[asciidoc] also made
blogpost, which wraps asciidoc output and lets you post it to wordpress blogs
like this. This post was edited in vim on my Linux machine and posted to this
website using blogpost like this:
...........................
blogpost.py post bptest.txt
...........................
And then it was re-edited in vim with more text and posted again via blogpost.
Yes blogpost will remember that the text file you edited on your local machine
is actually the source for a post on a blog somewhere on the internet.
