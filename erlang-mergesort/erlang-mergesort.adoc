Mergesort in Erlang
===================
Sashan Govender

Looking around for a language that would make sense for my next project, I've decided to look
into Erlang.

* It's a functional programming language.
* Predated Scala and the new wave of functional languages. In fact those languages are probably more
  influenced by Erlang.
* Inherently designed to support concurrent distributed processing on a large scale, although I
  doubt it can do the fine grained multicore shared memory stuff Julia could do.
* More suited to tasks that require parallel processing using message duplication as the primary
  way to share pass information. Don't use it for computationally intensive stuff.

So in the tradition of not many other first programs in a new language I wrote a
link:https://github.com/sashang/notebook_of_code/tree/master/erlang-mergesort[merge sort routine]

Some of the funky stuff I bumped up against:

* Seemingly bizzare usage of `,`, `;` and `.` as statement terminators. It reminded me of
  programming in OCaml.
* `if` statements aren't like anything I've ever seen before.
* Nice pattern matching. Love pattern matching in a language; it lets you break apart the shape of
  the data structure so easily.
* Concurrent process handling is so sweet.
