Bochs and a Kernel
===================
Sashan Govender

There's a basic tutorial here
http://www.jamesmolloy.co.uk/tutorial_html/2.-Genesis.html[here] on how to get started with a kernel. It uses Bochs
as 32 bit emulator. However recent versions of Bochs have been updated so that
this line in the config file:
..............................
romimage: file=/usr/share/bochs/BIOS-bochs-latest, address=0xf0000
..............................
must change to this:
..............................
romimage: file=/usr/share/bochs/BIOS-bochs-latest
..............................
