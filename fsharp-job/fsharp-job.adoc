Seems a bit surreal but I accepted a job offer for an F# role. At this moment I'm happy letting it sink in and getting in touch with my emotions. This piece isn't about the features of the language, or a piece about why everyone should use F#, or why it's better than _<insert language here>_. It's about the journey, and it's been a long one.

I started pottering around with OCaml in 2007. Fiddling in my spare time. I liked the language. Discriminated unions were great. The option type was great. I never delved into camlp4, the processor that lets you to meta-programming with the language. Powerful and weird all at the same time. I saw that Microsoft had an ML derivitive called F# so I had a play with that. I liked that it fixed the inversion of control associated with callbacks. Javascript has promises now that does a similar thing. I corrected an https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6182055/is-this-a-correct-desugaring-of-the-computation-workflow/6183478#6183478[error in Expert F# 2.0] along the way, but I never had an opportunity to make it my main language. At the time I was working in C++ on Linux. I didn't want to be programming on Windows even in my spare time so I put it to rest.

In 2018 I had another look at the language and the eco-system had moved on. .Net Core was available for Linux and I thought _great I'll give this a go_. A personal connection wanted a system to help with tutoring and built a side project https://tewtin.com based on the SAFE stack web framework. The community around F# was great.  I found them on a Slack forum and realised there were amazing programmers there doing astounding work. Astounding because I did not understand how they did what they did. I was constantly blown away by the creativity and ease they came up with these fantastic libraries and utilities, an ease that I have yet to match. In the mean time, I floundered like a baby duck trying to keep afloa.I streamed some https://www.twitch.tv/videos/366933831[coding sessions on twitch], and got weird questions from my peers. _What is F#? Nobody uses it. Are you insane? Just use Javascript like everyone else._ I'd counter with, _but I can write the backend and frontend in the F# and I get static type checking_. To which I'd receive a non-committal reply. It was lonely forging ahead alone with something few people understand. Did I fear that I'd overcommitted to a 'dead' language? No. For some reason that never crossed my mind. I never used Java since I think it's a terrible language and C++ is better for system level applications. It was hyped as a silver-bullet in the early 2000's. Maybe that's why I avoided it.  _Why make everything an object? Garbage collection doesn't save you from leaking resources_

All the work I've put into F# has come to fruition. I feel vindicated. I accepted an offer from https://tab.com.au to work in their cloud engineering team where tons of data is processed per second using F# because it results in better performance. Performance is compute, and compute time in the cloud is money.
